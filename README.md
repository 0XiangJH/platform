    In order to better serve the automatic phase picking work, it is used by personnel in the corresponding field.
#### Area / industry oriented :
    seismological researches
#### The main functions of the software :
    The visualization platform of seismic phase inspection is to use advanced GUI technology to innovate the seismic phase pickup inspection mode, implement the visualization of seismic phase inspection, realize the parametric control of the whole process of seismic phase reproduction, fine adjustment, screening, free inspection and sorting, so as to build a more scientific, efficient and convenient seismic phase inspection system. Through the innovative application model, the seismic phase picking work mode of seismic science and technology personnel is innovated, so that the seismic phase picking truly feels the convenience, effectiveness and economy of computer technology, and realizes the burden reduction of scientific research.
#### The technical characteristics of the software :
    By checking the practice of visualization, the artificial phase picking is gradually replaced by the man-machine cooperative phase picking, and the parameter standard of phase picking is standardized in practice. At the same time, the time cost of seismic phase picking is reduced, and the efficiency of picking and inspection is improved. From application to promotion, the intelligent and visualization of picking up seismic phases is steadily realized.
